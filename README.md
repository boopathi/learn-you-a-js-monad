# learn you a js monad

### Are you looking to use something in Production?

Definitely not for you

### Are you looking to learn what monads are?

Maybe NOT the best place for you

### Curious what monads in JS are?

Maybe NOT for you too

### What the heck is this?

I'm trying to learn Monads by defining what Monads are using simple constructs in a language, where there is dynamic/runtime typing, no pattern matching, (inclusion) polymorphism through method overriding, duck typing, no generics etc..., by faking some of the things that I think I need to define.

### Are you a critic?

##### Wanna help me learn by pointing out mistakes?

Open an issue or submit a PR. Thanks!
